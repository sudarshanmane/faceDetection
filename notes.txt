--> Referencing and Embedding


 ---> * direct populate vs virtual populate 
 when a schema has id of another schema then we can directly populate else we have to 
 populate it using virtual

 When a field in one schema directly references the _id of another schema using 
 mongoose.Schema.ObjectId and the ref option, you can directly use .populate()
  to automatically fetch the referenced documents.

 When you want to reference documents in another collection but don't store their 
 ObjectIds directly, or when you want to establish a reverse relationship, you use a virtual field.



write this only when not defined 'tour' variable in schema
// reviewsSchema.virtual('tour', {
//   ref: 'Tour',
//   foreignId: 'tour',
//   localId: '_id'
// });
